# Evolutionary-Ship-Pathfinding

Java code for simulating evolution with ships designed to path-find.

In this simulation, ships are made up of boosters that evolve over time.

These boosters evolve through a genetic algorithm to allow ships to navigate somewhat complex environments.

Usage:

```
javac genetic/*.java
java genetic.Genetic
```
